Economic forecast: below-average growth, high degree of uncertainty
The Federal Government Expert Group on Business Cycles has slightly lowered its growth forecast for the Swiss economy. In 2025, GDP adjusted for sporting events is expected to grow by 1.4%, followed by 1.6% in 2026 (December forecasts: 1.5% and 1.7% respectively). This would mean the Swiss economy would continue to grow below its historical average for another two years. These forecasts presuppose that there will be no escalating global trade war. In view of the considerable uncertainty, SECO has formulated two alternative scenarios to supplement the expert group’s forecast.
