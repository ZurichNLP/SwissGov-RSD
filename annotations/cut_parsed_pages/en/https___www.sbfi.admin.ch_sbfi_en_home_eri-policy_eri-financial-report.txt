ERI Financial Reports
ERI financial reports provide a consolidated and comprehensive overview of current and planned ERI expenditure. These reports cover overall public funding of the ERI sector, federal expenditure set forth in Federal Council ERI dispatches and co-funding of specific ERI sub-sectors by the Confederation and the cantons.
ERI financial reports are used as a planning tool for the periods covered by each ERI dispatch. As such, ERI financial reports are published at the same intervals as ERI dispatches, usually every four years. In addition, annual ERI bulletins show key ERI figures for the given year.
