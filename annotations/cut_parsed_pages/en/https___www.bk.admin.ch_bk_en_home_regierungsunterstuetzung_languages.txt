Languages
The Federal Administration serves a multilingual public, and must therefore provide publications in German, French and Italian. Some texts are published in Romansh and English. The language specialists at the Federal Chancellery ensure that all laws and other official texts are clear and legally correct in the given language. This requires very careful attention as the French, German and Italian language versions of all laws are equal and legally binding.
