Objectives
With its programme strategy for the period from 2021 to 2030, SwissEnergy aims to organise its management more flexibly in order to keep pace with the developments on the energy market. The measures defined in the various fields of action are oriented on objectives that arise from the official energy strategy and the Federal CO2 Act or its fundamentals.
The objectives specified in the programme strategy thus do not represent any new criteria and make no political demands. They solely define the orientation of the SwissEnergy programme.
