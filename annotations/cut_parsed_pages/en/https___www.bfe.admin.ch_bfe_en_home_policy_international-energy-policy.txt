International energy policy
Over 70 per cent of Switzerland's overall energy supply depends on imports of fossil fuels and nuclear fuels from abroad. Even the country's electricity supply is dependent on imports, at least during the winter.
Switzerland's high dependence on imports, the need to ensure security of supply and its climate targets make close cooperation with international energy organisations and foreign energy authorities indispensable.
Regular talks are held with neighbouring countries at Federal Council and director level. The areas of cooperation range from security of supply and infrastructure to the promotion of renewable energies, energy efficiency matters and research cooperation.
In the negotiations with the EU on an electricity agreement, Switzerland is prioritising the legal protection of its position in the European energy market.
Furthermore, Switzerland is involved in multilateral bodies such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Energy Charter and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), in which it participates as a member.
