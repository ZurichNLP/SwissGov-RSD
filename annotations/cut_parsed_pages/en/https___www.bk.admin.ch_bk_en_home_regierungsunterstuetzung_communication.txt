Communication
Following the Federal Council meetings, one of the federal councillors is usually available to publicly answer questions on the main decisions that have been made. Press conferences are organised by the Federal Chancellery and chaired by the Federal Council spokesperson. The Federal Chancellery broadcasts these press conferences live online and issues information via a range of channels, including social media and the admin.ch website.
The Federal Chancellery also drafts the Federal Council explanatory guides on initiatives and referendums coming up for a national vote.
For full information please select German, French or Italian.
