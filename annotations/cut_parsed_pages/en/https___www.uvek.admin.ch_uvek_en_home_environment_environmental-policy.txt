Principles of environment policy
Although nature represents the foundation of life in all its forms, human beings do not always act in harmony with it. Our consumption of resources is far too high, we are causing flora and fauna to become extinct and are polluting the planet's soil. Protecting the environment is therefore one of the central duties of every government, since in this way they are also protecting their vital infrastructure.
Environment policy at home
Originally, the focus of Switzerland's environment policy was limited to the meanwhile firmly anchored protection of bodies of water, the air, the soil and various biotopes, as well as certain species of flora and fauna. These early efforts proved to be highly successful:
Today's environment policy has a significantly broader focus: the Federal Council is adopting a more protective approach to the use of natural resources. In addition, it is taking more comprehensive steps aimed at protecting natural habitats and ecological systems, as well as species of flora and fauna.
Environment policy at the international level
Environment policy has long since become a global issue:
Switzerland also maintains bilateral agreements on environmental protection, for example with China, with which it has been cooperating for a number of years in the area of flood prevention.
