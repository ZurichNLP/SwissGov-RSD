Competitive calls for tenders – ProKilowatt
ProKilowatt reduces electricity consumption by companies in the industry and services sectors, as well as by private households, through the financial support of measures to increase its efficient use. It supports projects and programmes that meet the specified requirements and save as much electricity as possible per provided Swiss franc. The source of the funding is an electricity network surcharge which accumulates up to 70 million Swiss francs per annum.
Efficiency measures may be supported in the form of projects or programmes.
