Federal architecture
The goal of enterprise architecture is to assemble the components, including all of their characteristics and relationships, into a functioning whole, so that the enterprise goals are optimally supported, duplications are avoided, and cooperation is simplified. This is achieved in part by providing and applying generally recognised standards.
Organisation
Enterprise architecture development in the Federal Administration is carried out according to a federated approach by the DTI Sector, the departments, the federal offices and service providers.
Departments and federal offices
The departments and administrative units develop the enterprise architecture in a decentralised manner for their core task areas.
Federal offices with cross-divisional tasks
Federal offices with cross-divisional tasks, e.g. the Federal Finance Administration (FFA) or the Federal Office of Topography (swisstopo), define and coordinate the enterprise architecture for the cross-divisional aspects in their area of responsibility.
DTI Sector
The DTI Sector assumes the role of enterprise architect at the federal level and provides the necessary methods, processes and tools to envision and develop the federal architecture.
Federal Architecture Board
The Federal Architecture Board is the expert committee at which the service providers and service consumers of architecture-related businesses come together to discuss issues and take decisions on architectural requirements.
Process and methodology
The Federal Administration uses TOGAF as the methodology for enterprise architecture management.
