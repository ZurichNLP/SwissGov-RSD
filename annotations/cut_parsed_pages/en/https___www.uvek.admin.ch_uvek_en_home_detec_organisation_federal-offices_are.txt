Federal Office for Spatial Development ARE
As the Swiss population grows, housing and mobility have become major concerns. The resulting construction and infrastructure projects have led to a greater use of land. To date, spatial development in Switzerland has not been sustainable enough. This runs counter to the objectives of the Federal Constitution and the Spatial Planning Act. It is therefore essential that settlements and infrastructures be better aligned with one another. The Federal Office for Spatial Development (ARE) supports this endeavour by promoting corresponding initiatives such as federal agglomeration programmes, which seek to make spatial development more sustainable.
Moreover, ARE has worked with the cantons, towns and communes to develop the Swiss Territory Project, which will serve as the basis for future spatial development in our country. ARE also guides and coordinates revision of the Spatial Planning Act, which is currently being debated in parliament.
