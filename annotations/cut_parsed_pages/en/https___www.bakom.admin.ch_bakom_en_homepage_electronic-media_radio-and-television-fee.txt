Radio and television fee
In principle, all Swiss households as well as businesses and collective households pay a fee for radio and television. The obligation to pay the fee does not depend on whether equipment which makes it possible to receive radio or television programme services (radios or TV sets, smartphones, tablets or computers with internet access) is present.
