Federal Office of Transport FOT
The Federal Office of Transport (FOT) is responsible for development and financing of the railway infrastructure. It conducts projects commissioned by the Federal Council and parliament. It also monitors compliance with established budgets and timetables and issues the necessary permits.
Switzerland is a nation of rail travellers. No other country in Europe has such a high density of railway traffic. Our country even leads the world in terms of distance travelled. Switzerland also has the highest share of rail in the freight transport market in Europe. This is the result of a consistent transport policy that encourages expansion of the railway network. The FOT is also responsible for supervising the safety of public transport. It issues regulations intended to ensure safe construction and operation. It carries out random inspections to monitor safety compliance among public transport companies. The aim is to maintain, or even increase, the high level of safety.
