Access to official documents
On 1 July 2006 the Federal Act on Freedom of Information in the Administration (Freedom of Information Act) came into force. Since this date, all persons have the right to access official documents from the Federal Administration, provided there are no predominant public or private interests related to the disclosure of the document that prevent this. This right is independent of the nationality or the domicile of the person submitting a request; and no specific reason is required.
It is possible to consult documents issued after 1 July 2006.
If you are interested in consulting an official document, please submit your request to the competent department or to the Federal Chancellery:
Requests should be as precise as possible to help us identify the document. If possible, please specify the title, the field concerned, and the authority that prepared the document, the reference as well as a specific period of time or the creation date.
