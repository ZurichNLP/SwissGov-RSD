The Energy label for cars
The energy label provides information about the fuel consumption (in litres per 100 kilometres), CO2 emissions (in grams per kilometre) and the energy efficiency of the vehicle. It contributes to reducing the average fuel consumption of new cars. The label must be displayed in a clearly visible manner directly on the vehicle or in its immediate vicinity. The details included in the label as well as some further information also have to be displayed in advertisements, in online configuration tools and in sales material.
The label increases the degree of transparency for buyers of new cars, and thus helps them decide which model to buy. This decision has a direct influence on the operating costs, and in particular on the ongoing fuel and electricity costs.
