Export Control
Within export control, the Safeguards Section acts as technical advisor to the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and to the Nuclear Energy Legal Section of SFOE when granting licences for exports of nuclear goods or their technology.
It issues licences itself in cases where SFOE takes the place of SECO in accordance with the Goods Control Ordinance (GCO). It also arranges for the Government to Government Assurances (GTGAs) for export or import of nuclear goods under the agreements of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) to be obtained or issued before controlled goods may be transferred. In export activities involving nuclear goods or their technology, which are dealt with by the federal government's interdepartmental export control group, the Safeguards Section represents the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC).
