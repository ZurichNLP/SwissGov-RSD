Federal Council Affairs
Almost every week the seven federal councillors convene for their regular meeting, which usually lasts about three hours. Each year the Federal Council deals with around 2,500 items of business. For this to be possible, the decisions must be well prepared and the processes in the Federal Administration must function smoothly. It is the Federal Chancellery’s task to help prepare the items of business and the documents that are presented to the federal councillors, making adjustments to the text on a legal and linguistic level.
The Federal Chancellery organises the meetings in conjunction with the department of the current president. For example, it draws up the agenda, coordinates the joint reporting procedure and formalises the Federal Council decisions with legally binding decrees.
