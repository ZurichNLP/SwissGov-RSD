SWEET KTT Toolbox – 30 method cards, 6 project phases, 5 criteria
The box contains 30 cards with well-known KTT methods for the interaction with stakeholders, which have been newly compiled especially for the SWEET consortia. Each card describes one method and is colour-coded to a specific project phase. In addition, the cards have been categorised according to five criteria and perforated accordingly. With the help of a stick, the cards that correspond to the desired mix of criteria can be quickly filtered out. Experiences with the individual methods can be written directly on the respective card. Further methods can be added on coloured blank cards.
A digital version of the toolbox can be found under “Documents”. The Toolbox is only available in English.
The toolbox is primarily aimed at SWEET consortia. It is intended to provide low-threshold access to the topic, to provide inter- and transdisciplinary teams with new impulses for their KTT activities and to promote dialogue within the project team. The toolbox is well suited for use in workshops with internal and external stakeholders.
A physical toolbox is provided to SWEET consortia by the SWEET Office. However, the toolbox can also be used by researchers in other thematic areas and by authorities and practitioners.
