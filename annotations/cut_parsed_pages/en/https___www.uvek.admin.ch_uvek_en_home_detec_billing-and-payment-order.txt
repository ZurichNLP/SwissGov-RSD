Billing and payment options
Requirement of electronic invoicing (“e-billing”) with effect from 2016
On 8 October 2016, the Federal Council announced its decision requiring suppliers of goods and services to the federal administration to submit electronic invoices if the contractual amount exceeds 5,000 Swiss francs. As before, invoices for smaller amounts may be submitted in paper form. This requirement was introduced with effect from 1 January 2016.
For suppliers: send us your invoices electronically
“E-billing” is the modern, convenient and secure form of invoicing. Instead of printing out your invoices and sending them by post to the federal administration, transfer them electronically via an “e-billing” service provider.
For clients: receive invoices electronically
We offer the option of electronic invoicing, which you can choose by registering with us as an “e-billing” recipient. You will then have the option of conveniently processing electronic invoices via the online banking facility of your financial institution, or importing them via various channels into your financial software for processing.

This means you no longer have to enter account details, amounts and references, and will be able to conveniently check invoices and release them for payment via online banking.
