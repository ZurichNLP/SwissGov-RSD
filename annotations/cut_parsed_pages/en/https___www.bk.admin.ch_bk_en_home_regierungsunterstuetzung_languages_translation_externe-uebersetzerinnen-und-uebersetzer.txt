Outsourcing translations
Does a translation need to be outsourced?
Article 11 of the Language Services Ordinance and section 4 of the Federal Chancellery instructions on the provision of language services regulate the use of external translators. Texts can be outsourced for translation in urgent cases or when the internal services have too much work and when all other internal options have been exhausted.
How do I outsource a translation?
If you need to send a text out for translation, you should first contact the section in charge of language services.
If your department’s head translator cannot put you in touch with a translator, you can contact the Federal Chancellery, which maintains a list of qualified external translators.
