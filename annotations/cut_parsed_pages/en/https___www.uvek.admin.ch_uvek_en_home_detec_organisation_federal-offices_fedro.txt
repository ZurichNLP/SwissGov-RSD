Federal Roads Office FEDRO
A smoothly functioning transport infrastructure is absolutely crucial for Switzerland's social and economic life. Today, our roads account for around 84 percent of passenger transport, and the motorways and national roads play a central role. Although they only constitute 2.5 percent of the overall road network, they handle 43 percent of passenger transport and 68 percent of goods haulage. The Federal Roads Office (FEDRO) is responsible for individual road transport and is committed to securing a smoothly functioning, environmentally compatible and safe motorway/national roads network.
The employees of the Road Infrastructure Division, which is divided into five regional offices and two external units, are responsible for the seamless processing of maintenance and expansion projects throughout the country. With the aid of state-of-the-art traffic management systems, the personnel of the Road Networks Division monitor and control traffic flows so that road users are able to reach their destination as quickly and safely as possible. And FEDRO's Road Traffic Division helps ensure that only safe vehicles and well-educated drivers are permitted on Switzerland's road network.
FEDRO maintains close contact with representatives from the fields of research and development, as well as from the industrial sector and tertiary education institutions, and in this way it is able to constantly incorporate the latest scientific findings into its standards and regulations - in the interests of sustainable mobility for Switzerland, today and in the future.
