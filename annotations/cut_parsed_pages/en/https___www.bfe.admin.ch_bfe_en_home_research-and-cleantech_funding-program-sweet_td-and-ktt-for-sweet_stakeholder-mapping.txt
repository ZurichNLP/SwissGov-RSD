Stakeholder Mapping
In order to disseminate the findings of the consortia to society, economics and politics, it is essential that relevant stakeholders are engaged throughout the entire research process. Targeted stakeholder management is a crucial aspect of this. In the document “Programme-Level Stakeholder Mapping”, the SWEET Office presents a visualisation of the stakeholder landscape at programme level, with a particular focus on multipliers. Existing and newly forming consortia can utilise this template as a basis for their own stakeholder mapping, adapting it to their specific needs. The document will also provide recommendations on how consortia can develop their own stakeholder maps. This will include guidance on analysing topic areas, identifying stakeholders and visualising them, as well as implementing knowledge transfer.
