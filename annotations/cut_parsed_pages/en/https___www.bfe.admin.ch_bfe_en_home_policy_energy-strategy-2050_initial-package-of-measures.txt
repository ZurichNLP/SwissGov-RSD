Initial package of measures
The first set of measures in Energy Strategy 2050 aims at increasing energy efficiency and promoting the development of renewable energies. Most of the measures planned by the Federal Council required enacting changes to the law in Parliament. In the course of the consultations on this subject Parliament has rejected certain of these measures, which will, therefore, no longer be mentioned below. However, other measures have been introduced by Parliament.
