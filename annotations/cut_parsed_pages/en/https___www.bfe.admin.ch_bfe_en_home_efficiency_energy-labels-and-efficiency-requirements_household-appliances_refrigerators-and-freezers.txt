The energy label for refrigerators and freezers
This label provides information about the energy efficiency of the declared appliances. When we buy a new fridge or freezer, it is not only the purchase price that counts, but also the associated long-term electricity costs. With this label it is possible to identify the most energy-efficient models at a glance.
In addition to the level of energy consumption and the noise level, the label also indicates the utilisable capacity of declared refrigerators and freezers.
The information provided on the label is based on the results of a standardised test over a period of 24 hours. Ambient temperature and usage also influence the level of energy consumption.
