Central Language Services, Italian Division
The Italian Division of the Central Language Services, established in 1917 as the Secretariat for Italian-speaking Switzerland, is the oldest language service at the Federal Chancellery. It comprises the Legislation and Language Section, based in Bern, and the Translation and Editing Section, based in Bellinzona.
Italian version of federal legislation
The Italian Division is the unit directly responsible for drawing up the Italian version of federal laws. As such it is responsible for the publication of the Italian edition of the Federal Gazette and the Official Compilation of Federal Legislation, in which the official documents issued or approved by the Federal Council and Parliament (messages, federal laws and decrees, ordinances, international treaties, etc.) appear.
The Italian Division participates on a permanent basis in the work of the parliamentary Italian drafting committee and runs its secretariat.
This body, which serves both the government and Parliament, has a special and independent position, in particular since the legislative process occurs almost exclusively in German and French, and very rarely in Italian, since the language is not sufficiently represented in the Federal Administration.
Italian translations for the Federal Chancellery and the Parliamentary Services
The Italian Division also provides Italian language services for the Federal Chancellery and the Parliamentary Services, translating official texts for these two institutions, in particular reports, press releases, documents, newsletters, internet pages, etc.
Translation coordination and language consulting services
Finally, the Italian Division also assumes coordination tasks for all Italian translation in the Federal Administration and advises the Italian-speaking regions on language issues.
