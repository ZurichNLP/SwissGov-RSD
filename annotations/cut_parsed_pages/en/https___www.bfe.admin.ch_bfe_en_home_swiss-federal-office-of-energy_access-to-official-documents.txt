Access to official documents
It is possible to gain access to official SFOE documents under the Freedom of Information Act. This applies to documents produced after 1 July 2006.
There is no complicated procedure for requesting access – a written request is not required. You just need to provide enough information for us to identify the document requested. Give as much information as possible: the date the document was created, the title or references, the exact subject domain and the time period it refers to are all useful. The SFOE may ask you to provide greater precision if your request is not detailed enough or if you are asking for multiple documents.
We will respond to the request within 20 days. This period may be extended, in which case you will be informed.
The procedure for accessing official documents is governed by the Freedom of Information Act and the associated ordinance.
Contact
You can apply for access to official documents in writing by email or post using the form attached below. However, as mentioned above, a request for access can also be submitted informally (via ).
