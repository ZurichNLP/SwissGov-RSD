Efficiency improvements by electricity suppliers
As part of the Federal Act on a Secure Electricity Supply from Renewable Energy Sources, the Swiss Parliament has set a target of saving 2 TWh by 2035 through energy efficiency measures. To achieve this, a new instrument will be introduced in 2025: energy efficiency improvements by electricity suppliers.
This new instrument will set savings targets for electricity suppliers to be achieved through the implementation of various measures at the level of end users in Switzerland (including, for instance, businesses and private households). Specifically, electricity suppliers must demonstrate that end-users have implemented measures to increase electricity efficiency - for example in the areas of electric motors, lighting, ventilation, refrigeration or similar systems and appliances.
Electricity suppliers can choose to provide these efficiency services themselves or outsource them. They can also acquire evidence of efficiency measures carried out by third parties.
Up until 30 April 2025 electricity suppliers must submit their annual figures and can submit measures that were implemented between the 1 January 2022 and the 31 December 2024 to the SFOE. Additional information and documents from the webinars can be found below:

Electricity suppliers will be issued their first targets for 2026 by 30 June 2025. To calculate these, they must report their electricity sales figures for 2024 to the SFOE by 30 April 2025 using the e-transmission form (PrivaSpTM). A corresponding guideline is available .

Measures that have already been implemented between 1 January 2022 and 31 December 2024 can be submitted for crediting request until 30 April 2025 using the e-transmission form. A corresponding guideline is available .
Next steps
The administrative office has been active since 1 March 2025. It serves as the first point of contact for all topics and can be reached during normal office hours using the following contact details:
