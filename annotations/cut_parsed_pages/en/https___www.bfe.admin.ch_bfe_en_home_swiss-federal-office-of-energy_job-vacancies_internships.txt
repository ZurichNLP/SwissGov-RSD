Internships
You can get to know the SFOE while you are completing your studies at a university or college of technology, or after you have obtained your degree or diploma. We offer you an opportunity to put what you have learned into practice and gain initial hands-on experience. At the SFOE you can participate in a variety of attractive projects, and will also be able to witness political work at first hand by attending a session of Parliament. We attach a great deal of value to furthering other essential skills such as networked thinking, networking capacity, entrepreneurial thinking, management skills, etc. As a trainee you will, for example, have an opportunity to spend a full working day observing and assisting a member of the management board.
Our internship scheme is also designed to prepare trainees for a career in the energy sector and/or at the SFOE.
We offer practical training in all our divisions, including Directorate Affairs. Traineeships last for a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of 12 months, and applicants must have completed their studies within the past 12 months.
If you are interested, please contact Mrs Nathalie Straub on 058 465 28 11.
We would be particularly pleased to hear from French-speaking and Italian-speaking applicants.
