SWEET: Sustainable Fuels
Sustainable fuels will make important contributions to achieving the goals of the energy strategy and the long-term climate strategy. They are the thematic focus of the call “Sustainable Fuels and Platform Chemicals”, to which the Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA) and armasuisse are also contributing.
The researchers are to investigate how Switzerland can meet its future needs for sustainable fuels and platform chemicals. Technologies for production, transport, distribution, storage and use are to be further developed. Furthermore, researchers are to show how the additional potential of Swiss farmyard manure can be profitably used for the production of sustainable fuels and platform chemicals.
After a two-stage evaluation by a panel of independent experts, the following consortium was selected:
