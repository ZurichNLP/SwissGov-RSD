Solar roof
Is my roof suitable for a solar installation? This question can easily be answered for any building roof in Switzerland, from detached houses to industrial buildings. In the sonnendach.ch application, all house roofs are visualised according to their suitability for the use of solar energy. The aim is to visualise the potential of solar energy use. Sonnendach.ch provides information for interested private individuals and also serves as a data basis for further analyses and as a planning basis, e.g. for potential studies by cantons and municipalities or for electricity grid planning.
