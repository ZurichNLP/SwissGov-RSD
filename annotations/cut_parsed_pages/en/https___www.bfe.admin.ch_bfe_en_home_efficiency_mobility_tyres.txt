Safe, quiet and energy-efficient tyres
Tyres account for around 20 percent of a vehicle's fuel consumption. The main factor here is rolling resistance. Lower rolling resistance reduces fuel consumption as well as CO2 emissions.
The energy label is intended to help people choose the best tyres, i.e. those that save energy and are also safe and quiet. Use of the energy label for tyres has been mandatory in Switzerland since 1 August 2014.
It indicates the energy efficiency (rolling resistance) and classifies the degree of grip on wet roads as well as the noise level. In addition, the label contains information on the snow and ice grip of the corresponding tyre. The design of the label is regulated in Appendix 4.2 of the Federal Energy Efficiency Ordinance, which is harmonised with Regulation (EC) 2020/740.
