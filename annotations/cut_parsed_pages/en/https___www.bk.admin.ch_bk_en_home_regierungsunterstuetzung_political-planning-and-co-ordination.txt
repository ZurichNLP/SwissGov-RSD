Strategic Management Support
What will Switzerland look like in the year 2030? What challenges does the country face? These are questions that the Federal Chancellery attempts to answer for the Federal Council. It monitors international trends, constructs scenarios and, on the basis of these, proposes the political action to be taken. This forms the basis of the four year legislature plan, from which the Federal Council’s annual objectives are derived. The Federal Council annual report sets out whether these objectives were attained.
