The Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC)
DETEC deals with infrastructure and environmental matters. Modern transport routes, communication networks and the power grid all fall under its remit. However, DETEC also deals with issues relating to the environment and health and safety. This concentration of user interests and protection interests under one roof can often create conflicting objectives. Decisions must therefore often be very carefully prepared.
