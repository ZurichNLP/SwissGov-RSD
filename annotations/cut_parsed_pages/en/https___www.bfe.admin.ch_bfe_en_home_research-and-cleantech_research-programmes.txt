Research programmes
The SFOE provides subsidiary support for research projects that correspond to the priorities of its current energy research concept (2021 to 2024). The main focus is on application-oriented and development-related research projects. It is advisable for applicants to contact the head of the research programme (relevant SFOE contact) before they submit an application for support.
