Electricity agreement Switzerland – EU
Switzerland is physically and geographically closely integrated into the EU's electricity system, but it lacks legal guarantees. This is associated with disadvantages for Switzerland.
In 2024, Switzerland and the European Union negotiated a package covering various areas, including an agreement on electricity. At the end of December 2024, the Federal Council took note of the material conclusion of these negotiations.
The electricity agreement should help to strengthen security of supply and grid stability, as well as to simplify electricity trading.
