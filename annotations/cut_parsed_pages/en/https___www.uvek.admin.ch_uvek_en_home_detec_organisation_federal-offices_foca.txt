Federal Office of Civil Aviation FOCA
The Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA) is responsible for development and supervision of civil aviation in Switzerland. It sees to it that civil aviation in Switzerland is optimally linked with international hubs, meets high safety standards and develops in a sustainable fashion. A high level of safety compared to other countries in Europe is achieved through a system of certifications and inspections. In order to further improve the safety mindset in Swiss aviation, the FOCA has implemented new instruments such as safety management systems. Such systems enable companies to assess their own safety and take measures as needed.
The FOCA represents Switzerland in discussions with Germany regarding flight paths on the approach to Zurich Airport. The FOCA is also actively involved in the Single European Sky project, which seeks to establish a uniform air traffic control system in Europe.
