Fuel Cells
Fuel cells directly change chemical energy into electricity and heat – very efficiently too and with very low pollution emissions. There is a broad scope of application for fuel cells, and they are currently used in a wide variety of areas. For example, large stationary fuel cell parks in the megawatt range have recently been realised, worldwide more then 200,000 micro co-generation plants based on fuel cells are in operation, and various vehicle manufacturers have already begun series production of fuel-cell powered vehicles. Double digit percentage growth is anticipated in the global market for fuel cells.
