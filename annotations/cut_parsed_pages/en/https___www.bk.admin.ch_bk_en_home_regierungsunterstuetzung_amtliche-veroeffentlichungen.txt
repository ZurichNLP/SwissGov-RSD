Official Publications
All acts, ordinances and decrees in Switzerland are published as quickly as possible. The Federal Chancellery is responsible for publishing all legislative texts in the Federal Gazette and in the Official and Classified Compilations of Federal Legislation. All publications are accessible online. What is more, the electronic version takes priority over the printed one. Few pages on the Federal Administration website are consulted as often as the portal on federal law. Every day, thousands of people – lawyers in particular – make use of this service provided by the Federal Chancellery.
