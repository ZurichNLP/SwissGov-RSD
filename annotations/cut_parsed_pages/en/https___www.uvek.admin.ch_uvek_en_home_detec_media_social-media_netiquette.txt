We invite you to visit our social media channels and interact with us and other people. The comment columns are intended as a place for lively debate. You can contribute to an atmosphere of respect and polite behaviour by observing the following:
All users have the right to express their opinions in the comment sections of our social media channels. However, comments may be removed if they:
Comments that are suspected of constituting an official offence – e.g. discriminatory comments based on race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation, or comments that incite hatred or violence – may in addition be reported to the police.
Comments may be automatically checked and temporarily removed if we receive an exceptionally high number of postings.
We reserve the right to block users on any of our social media platforms for a maximum of two years if their comments pose a particularly serious violation of the rules or if they post comments multiple times that fall under any of the above-mentioned criteria.
