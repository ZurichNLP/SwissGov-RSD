Please do not disturb
Internet and stores abroad are full of interesting offers for wireless devices (drones, remote controlled toys, telephones, repeater, radio equipment,...). All are using frequencies to communicate with each other or with their base. If they operate on frequencies which are not assigned to them, they can cause disturbances. Before a purchase, watch OFCOM's video, you will find the points you should keep in mind.
