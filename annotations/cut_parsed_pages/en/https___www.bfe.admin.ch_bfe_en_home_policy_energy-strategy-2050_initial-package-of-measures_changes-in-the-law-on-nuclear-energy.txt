Changes in the law on nuclear energy
Ban on new nuclear power plants
Under the new law no permits for the construction of new nuclear power plants or any basic changes to existing nuclear power plants will be delivered. The existing nuclear power plants may stay in operation for as long as they remain safe. It is the Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate (ENSI) which decides whether conditions for safe operation are being met. This is an independent authority of the Confederation.
Ban on the reprocessing of spent fuel
In 2003 Parliament passed a moratorium on the export of spent fuel rods for the purposes of reprocessing. This law is in force until June 2016. Under the new legislation, the export of spent fuel rods for reprocessing is banned indefinitely.
