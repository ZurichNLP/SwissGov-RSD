Provision of services (max. 90 days per year)
EU/EFTA citizens wishing to carry out a regulated professional activity in Switzerland for a maximum of 90 working days per calendar year must submit a declaration form to SERI before providing the service. If the professional activity has a potential impact on public health or safety, vocational and professional qualifications will be carefully checked by the competent authority. Processing times for service providers are shorter than the recognition procedure for people moving to Switzerland. An online portal has been set up to simplify the centralised procedure.
