The energy label for lamps
Lighting accounts for around 10 percent of Switzerland's electricity consumption. Since 2012, minimum requirements for the energy efficiency of light sources and control gears have been in force. In the course of the gradual tightening of these minimum requirements, almost all incandescent, halogen and integral compact fluorescent lamps have disappeared from the market today.
Since 1 September 2021, light sources must be declared with the new energy label. In addition to the energy efficiency class, the label also shows the power consumption per 1000 operating hours. Initially, there are still hardly any products with an A-class rating. This «empty» class leaves room for the development of future efficient products.
Since 2023, important new requirements apply on mercury in lamps for general lighting, in addition to the efficiency requirements: since 24 February 2023, compact fluorescent lamps, among others, can no longer be placed on the market, and since 24 August 2023, neither can T8 fluorescent tubes in all lengths (26 mm diameter linear fluorescent lamps) and T5 fluorescent tubes (16 mm diameter). Switzerland adopted these requirements identically to the EU, based on Directive 2011/65/EU on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (“RoHS”). The Federal Office for the Environment is in charge of this.
